Ultra flexible grid system where you can use columns of all sizes (until 960 pixels and 100%).

I started Precise CSS as a new grid system to use pixels and percentages in the same row. This idea is freshly baked in CSS code, so feedback / optimalizations are welcome.

Just include the precise.css or precise.min.css in your head.

If using Bootstrap, after Bootstrap CSS link

<pre><code>&lt;link href="&lt;path-to-file&gt;/precise.min.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt; 
</code></pre>
